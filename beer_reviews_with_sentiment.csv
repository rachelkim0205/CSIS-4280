beer,IPA,PSA: IPAS ARE POPULAR. WE KNOW.,"For Part 3 or my [PSA series](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/bgtz5d/psa_if_you_dont_like_a_particular_style_of_beer/), I'd like to address a common concern expressed on this sub - the popularity of IPAs.

Ok, listen. We are all very aware the IPAs are popular. We are aware that when you go to a bar, brewery or bottleshop, the vast majority of the offerings are IPAs - because IPAs are popular. We understand that this can be difficult for people that don’t like IPAs - but IPAs are popular. We’re all very sorry that your favorite style of beer isn’t as popular as IPAs.

No, we don’t know when the IPA “trend” is going to die - it’s been going strong for like 15 years and shows no sign of abating so probably not anytime soon. You might want to reconcile yourself to the fact that IPAs will likely remain popular for many years to come. No, I sincerely doubt that every bar in America will begin stocking a good English Mild any time soon.  No, everyone’s not “just going to go back to drinking German styles” in the near future. No, cask ales probably won’t ever be as popular in the US as they are in England. Sorry.

beer,IPA,Did Heady and Pliny spark the IPA boom in a way?,"Comment in another sub got me thinking back and reliving the evolution of IPAs. Time travel back to 2012 when the common ipa was a very malty 12 oz bottle that you bought a 12 or 24 pack of from your local distributor or store depending on state. A “local” brewery was often regional depending on where you lived and warranted an hour car ride for a Saturday day trip. Getting one of these on tap at your towns pub was considered a big deal and at minimum conversation worthy at work on monday. 

Life was good in the post college life if you had 20$ a week to spare on a lot of these brews. 2013 and 14 brought more seasonal releases of doubles and different styles which kind elevated the game and everyone would count the days till you could get your hands on a case (nugget nectar and dirt wolf for me). Try one of those beers now and they literally do taste like dirt. I lived in Denver for half of 2013 as well, and even there at the time with everything opening up, the IPAs were still overall fairly malty.

You would hear talk of these unicorn beers that were truly different and impossible to obtain. By the time I got my hands on heady topper the ipa race was well underway. For me, at the time, it definitely was the best ipa I had ever tasted. Fast forward to 2018 and the 4 pack craze was heading towards its peak. most people within an hour or two of a major metro could get beers that were in the same class as Heady, Pliny, Treehouse. The rest of the pre Covid era was a mad scramble to buy the wildest and different 4 packs you could find… 

Post Covid IPA and craft era has been covered enough on here, but the 2010’s were truly a fascinating and exciting time for craft IPAs and I can’t help but think that the Heady topper and Pliny the elder memes and folklore sparked the race…",1,0.9776,Positive,0.12543103448275864,Positive,0.5520670327586207,Positive

does the drop in sales for craft beers correlate with the surge of more IPAs being the offering from the craft brewers?

The drop in sales for craft beers does seem to correlate with the surge of IPAs being the primary offering from many craft brewers. While IPAs have been incredibly popular and have driven much of the growth in the craft beer market, their dominance has also led to market saturation. This saturation can result in a decline in overall sales as consumers seek variety and new experiences.

Additionally, the craft beer market has faced increased competition from other alcoholic beverages like hard seltzers and spirits-based drinks, which have gained popularity in recent years. This shift in consumer preferences, combined with the market saturation of IPAs, has contributed to the decline in craft beer sales.

beer,IPA,Tired of Hazy IPAs,"I love craft beer and have enjoyed the brewery boom over the last decade. However, the trend over the last few years has ruined my desire to go to any local spots. My favorite style is west coast or imperial IPAs. Anything that has that dry, slightly bitter finish. Barely any places brew anything other than juicy and hazy IPAs now. They are certainly trendy, and more importantly for the brewery, anyone can drink them. My feeling is that juicy and hazy IPAs are great for those who don't actually like IPAs. Am I alone in this take? I did order hazy IPAs back when they weren't as popular if I wanted to mix it up with something easy and refreshing. I did not expect some staple beers to be removed from menus to make room for hazy versions. I understand why they are popular, and I'm sure they generate money because they appeal to all drinkers, but I have no desire to go to a local spot for a drink, something I loved to do.

beer,lager,I drank 33 American lagers so you don't have to,"I've run the gamut on exploring different beer styles and have grown tired of the craft beer game. I've been drinking (good) lager most of the time lately, and have been thinking about how I've never had a shit lager phase. I drank mostly fruity vodka drinks and Crown Royal in college, and when I turned 21, I discovered the craft beer section at the grocery store and went from there. Then I started thinking, I should put together a shitty lager tasting and torture my friends! Now I've finally done it.
   
There are a lot of beers in this category, so I limited myself to 33, all American, including a handful of Michigan brewed and regional options. Most of these beers were within recommended freshness. 

We first sampled all 33 beers in one night. Getting through it all was a struggle. Trying so many similarly tasting beers in one night is *very* mentally exhausting, not to mention the exhaustion of excessive drinking. Yet, at the very end, the #1 beer was unanimously decided, and everyone's top 5 was pretty damn close. For the 4 months after the tasting, I drank several more of each to fine tune my ratings and comments. I drank them grouped by brewery, I've drank them worst to best, and I've done more side-by-sides than I can count. I questioned why I was laboring so hard over this pointless ranking... but I had to keep on going.
   
Perhaps the most eye-opening part of all this was how profoundly shitty it made me feel. The hangover made me feel so remarkably disgusting, considerably more so than craft beer ever has, and in a qualitatively different way. I'm thinking it's the dog food grade ingredients used in these shitty lagers. I hope to never feel that way again.

Anyways... on to the ranking!

Wonderfully balanced, flavorful, and clean maltiness with a well balanced hop note. This truly sets the standard for American macro lager.

2. [Pabst Blue Ribbon Extra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6fe817048ac162db1a589cc8fea60438_c_1351727722_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - I am surprised by how good this is compared to regular PBR. It's bolder but tastes like better quality ingredients too. There's a bit of a spicy earthy toasty hop thing, and a more substantial maltiness and body. Great stuff! It's also the only mass market lager I found packaged using the plastic PakTech can carriers.

Maybe a little more prominent wood flavor smoothing things out aside the crispy clean maltiness. Huge spread across the rankings from Budweiser!

I like it too. Beechwood gives the clean crushable maltiness a smooth woody flavor that I probably wouldn't notice if I wasn't overanalyzing it.

8. [Old Style](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f8ff28505fa3c2022b602fe45107f3e0_c_1351723127_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Chicago's favorite. It's maybe a little sweeter than most of the others but brings good body, a deliciously clean maltiness, and a light earthy hop.

9. [Strohs](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/83d58fdfa1969a792c00babda389da78_c_1351722825_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Formerly brewed in Detroit. Super clean maltiness with a well balanced melony lychee hop thing going on. My dad loves to tell me about his relatives who could drink on the job at the Stroh's factory (but not too much!). Anotehr fun fact - Stroh's spelled backwards is Short's!

10. [Altes](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/52c355dfa1f510a713c81e939fc8421b_c_1351722035_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Earthy bitter hops and piney sweetness atop a toasted caramel malty base and a crushable body. Maybe crystal malt? Nice hoppy amber vibes. Probably doesn't fit the category all that well, but I'm glad I've tried this Detroit classic.

11. [Michelob Ultra Pure Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/45503b76bfc1b25eecb452b0cfc7fcd3_c_1351721320_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Better flavor than regular Ultra. Nice clean crispy grainy lagery goodness. I'm thinking that going organic must also meant better ingredients.

12. [Michelob Ultra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/55dc8cbf5f54a8ca2346adf100cce120_c_1351720724_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Not bad for a light beer! Crispy and clean, maybe a touch of sweet cereal grains. Ultra light flavor overall, but the flavor that is there is surprisingly decent. It also keeps a consistent flavor as it warms up, which is why it ranks so high on my list.

13. [Pabst Blue Ribbon](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/365b6f4a5eaea49f0a78e66d8d88201f_c_1351719655_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - This is pretty much exactly what I think of when I picture the average American shit lager. Crispy and mostly clean with a little toasted malt and earthy hop, but the ingredients taste cheap overall.

14. [Coors Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/faee680671cca497c260ac9ade74e9fa_c_1351719275_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Coors has their carbonation profile down very well. Nice crispiness without the carbonic acid flavor other light beers have. There is a little clean malt flavor but it's pretty light. Tastes very meh when the carbonation dies down.

15. [Miller Genuine Draft](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/95be8f76debcce5f865763df04b6108f_c_1351718587_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Awesome label. Beer is fine. Less flavorful than High Life. Maybe a little sweeter and a little more artificial tasting. 

16. [Solid Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/b32158e8c3b5fd3ff073397133ea9ead_c_1351718049_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Sweet grainy aroma. Tastes a lot less artificial than the typical American lager, not to mention more complex, but its slapped right back down by gross corn flavor.

17. [Michelob Original](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/37294c62e0bc80db186f062634451482_c_1351717581_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - I didn't know this still existed! This is the hoppiest of the bunch, but that's not saying much. A light floral and earthy hop atop a clean yet slightly caramelly maltiness.

18. [Natural Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/0ad145fa017717a8adedfd632b79857d_c_1351717051_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - A little bolder than the average shit lager. A little melony hop and a crispy clean malty base. Some cans have hints of doo doo Natty Daddy flavor. Its inconsistent, just like Natty Daddy, but its usually on the better side

19. [Old Milwaukee Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6c2793b263d1662c5be7f0e82fee28c8_c_1351716320_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Another light beer that tastes very similar to the original, just a little lighter overall. A little drier too. A rare case of the light beer tasting better than the regular!

20. [Old Milwaukee](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/e58d5fc7f541c57cd089651e9ab1cbf9_c_1351715819_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Somewhat sweet cereal grains, like off brand Lucky Charms, and a clean finish. This is the only beer of this lineup I had to buy in 30 rack form, but I don't think I'll have a problem smashing through it.

21. [Bud Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3d42b5fba88293261a2f9358c3771f4b_c_1351714982_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Light and crisp with a nice clean maltiness. A little more carbonic bite. Not much else to it, which I suppose is the point.

22. [Strohs Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/4d47f2fb953dad2fd03cfc14e3bd12ee_c_1351714500_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Much lighter and less flavorful than the OG. There's a little carbonic astringency to it, but there's still some good flavor of the OG in there. It gets better as carbonation settles.

23. [Miller Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b9c4e51c0765995b5dafd0ccf2fe11f_c_1351713607_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - My first beer! I hated it then, but it's tolerable now. Certainly lighter than their other beers but theres some decent clean malty flavors in there.

24. [Natural Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fee828af2a15a1dcc8d5c7d8d49c4f9c_c_1351712910_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Nothing spectacular but it's light, crispy, clean, and inoffensive. I didn't hate drinking it. Although, I once drank this warm on an island with a local hermit, and it was pretty enjoyable that day.

25. [Busch](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/79448458d4a36cef2e92ecfaccb804d1_c_1351711316_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp and clean, but leaning hard into light beer territory in terms of flavor (or lack thereof) and abv at 4.3%. Getting a little corn coming through also.

26. [Busch Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c00390b8938369196870eb3be956aed5_c_1351710118_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp, clean, and a little corny. Tastes virtually the same as regular Busch, but it's also only 0.2% lighter so what's the point? If anything, it's just a little lighter and a little sweeter.

27. [ICEHOUSE](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/5fe379ccf1ca2498cc1914a8d76ab001_c_1351709617_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - It is certainly bolder than most. A mix of potent grains, slightly caramelly with a surprisingly clean and crushable finish.

28. [Bud Select](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fa5e3e0f41623b672dc523c7d7e944c8_c_1351709027_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - Crisp clean and light. Just tastes of meh super cheap ingredients. This is the only expired beer in the lineup (by 2 months), but I'm not sure it'd be much better if fresher.

29. [Bud Select 55](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3890426b9eb6a054dd5ba08f4058198b_c_1351708381_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Astringent carbonic acid, super light, void of flavor except some light and super cheap malt. Why the need for gross 2.4% 55 calorie beer? Just stop drinking!

30. [Natty Daddy](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f215c04e174ec59b9edf4fee86dd94db_c_1351707639_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Definitely stronger than your average shit lager. Not great though. Kind of an off brand honey cereal thing with a little boozy heft. Some cans are okay, but some taste downright awful.

31. [Bud Light Platinum](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c3a3200af4ccc8d526cb055746201f30_c_1351706335_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Why is a Bud Light variant their stronger than Bud Ice? This is bold in ways that do not taste good. Stronger shittier malt flavor and a heavier body. I can't believe so many people choose to drink this.

32. [Schlitz](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/98ae15d3804cfe7b06685a6ebca93429_c_1351704991_raw.jpeg) - 2.25/5 - Tastes like cheap sweet cereal grains, kind of a shitty caramel thing, and a little bitterness. It's gross.

beer,lager,Lagers are under appreciated,"I tend to experiment and try many beers in many styles. I tend to prefer lagers a majority of the time. I can appreciate a good stout and porters but only on special occasions.
When I go to the beer store it's almost all ales and IPAs. I am not a fan of ales and I do like some IPA's as long as they are not overly heavy/filling.
Most stores all carry the same stuff and it gets really boring. I would rather not drink any beer at that point. 
I end up drinking far less but better beers.
I stay away from the mainstream brewers and tend to go for craft or local brews.
Having said all that I wish more breweries took the time to craft quality lagers.
Why are there not more breweries open to brewing more lagers? Is it that the market isn't there? I don't really see that at the stores I go to where they carry a wide variety of craft beer. 
Is it more difficult to make a lager that stands out? Is it that lagers take a little longer to brew?

I did, however, have one great experience at an IPA bar around the corner from the Rockerfella Center. (Aside from nearly being taken out by the bouncer for walking past him without showing my ID, the IPAs were great.)

beer,lager,Does anyone know of any good craft breweries that specialize in lagers?,"Before I say anything else, I'm thinking there's a possibility that this is a very frequently asked question, so I apologize in advance if this is one of those questions that's mentioned in a pinned post that I failed to notice.

To return the favor, I'll list what I know of for anyone else who's also looking for the same thing.

I know of a few places such as Live Oak in Austin, Urban Chestnut in St. Louis, and Dovetail and Metropolitan in Chicago. All of these breweries focus on traditional German and Central European beers. Which isn't quite the same thing as making only lagers, although I enjoy a lot of their other offerings as well (such as their hefeweizens and koelsches). I believe a few of them also make some Belgian ales, and a few make stouts and pale ales, although Central Europe is still their main focus. So they'll definitely have much more to choose from than 16 IPAs. As for breweries that only make lagers, I know of Bierstadt in Denver and Goldfinger in Downers Grove (a suburb of Chicago). As far as I know those breweries have never made anything that doesn't use lager yeast. Which is quite an appreciated change to today's world of ale saturation.

There's really nothing like being able to go to a brewery and having to choose between a pilsner, a helles lager, a Vienna lager, a festbier or maerzen (if it's that time of year), and a dunkel or schwarzbier (my personal favorite) or bock or doppelbock or whatever their current seasonal offering is.

beer,lager,"Why does the Stella box I bought say “Imported Lager Beer” but tbh e bottles say brewed in St. Louis, MO?","So I am aware that AB has shifted their production over to the U.S., but the reason I bought this 12 pack was because it looked significantly different than the rest of them, with this one saying “Imported Lager Beer” instead of the normal “Premium Lager Beer.” I thought perhaps I finally stumbled upon an imported pack that was accidentally mixed with the rest somehow, but I was disappointed to find the “Brewed in the U.S.A.” stamp on the bottles. So was this a manufacturing error and the bottles ended up in the wrong box? Or were the bottles brewed in Belgium and they were imported by Import Brands  Alliance? The box and bottles seem to contradict themselves, so I was hoping someone in here could clarify, but I feel like this sort of falls under the lines of false advertising. The bottom of the box even says “Imported by Import Brands Alliance St. Louis, MO” so how can this be?

For those that have not tried it, it's one of the NW best old school lagers. Sure it would compare to a Budweiser, but this was all-malt. Straw color, crisp, decent number of bubbles, acceptable lacing for a lager and was cheap. You could refer to this as lawn mower beer or a beer you could kick back with your buddies or bring fishing like a Hamms.

There is a lot of history of this beer. In comparison you can still get its cousin, which is Rainier lager, but no longer brewed in the State of Washington to get an idea of what the brewers made back in the day before most of us were born.

Good news is there are two brewers that is brewing this beer. Locations below.

Scroll through the history here or perhaps on one of the beer tracking apps and jot down the beer types. When you've reached six, you've exceeded the variety that your average liquor store carried 30 years ago, that grew by another 6 to 10 over the next decade and then by early-2000's the micro-brewery model started to take off in earnest and leads us to now, today, where you can buy any Ale, Pale Ale, DIPA, DHIPA, DDHIPA, TIPA, Pilsner, Kolsch, Witbier, Belgian,.. well not going to list all 230 types the 'filter by style' on Untapped shows currently.  Compounded by the 'aged, aged on, flavored with.. anything.. literally anything' that applies to a good majority of those types. There ends up being some options.

So with that abundance never before experienced by humanity and the ability to order beer freaking online and have it delivered to your doorstep… ffs.

craftbeer,IPA,Is the huge popularity  / hype of the IPA styles a poisoned gift for the craft beer scene / beer lovers?,"Based on the huge popularity of IPA / NEIPA / DIPA etc (certainly also in this reddit) it may be ""controversial"" and ""risky"" to ask the question but here it comes.... Is the style becoming or has it become too dominant / popular and too hyped? I drink beer since 30+ years and started with pils, flemish red and strong Belgian blond beers. 15 years ago it was nearly impossible to find IPA beers in Belgium, not in the bars, not in shops.  I would be lying if I said it's my favourite style but I do drink IPA beers several times a month.  Over the last couple of years lot's and lot's of European breweries have stepped in the US footsteps and made their own IPA beers that are often mediocre and interchangeable.  Seeing copy after copy is getting a bit boring.  What makes it worse in my opinion is the fact that, based on what I am reading here on this reddit, in the US the IPA style has taken over most of the (craft) beer shelves space.  Making it harder to find other styles.  Lot's of brewers stopping with quads or tripels etc. In other words, less styles, less different kind of flavours due to the IPA boom of the last 10, 15 years?

I used to be all about the bold flavors—hoppy, resinous IPAs and high-proof, barrel-strength bourbons were my go-to. I loved the intensity, the complexity, and the punch they packed. But lately, I find myself reaching for something more refined and easygoing.

These days, I’m really enjoying crisp lagers and pilsners—clean, refreshing, and perfect for kicking back without overwhelming my palate. And when it comes to whisk(e)y, I’ve been gravitating toward Speyside and Islay Scotches. There’s something about their smooth, honeyed, smokey, and slightly fruity profiles that just hits right.

Has anyone else gone through a similar transition? Maybe it's palate fatigue, or just evolving tastes...

If I’m correct, math for total alcohol consumed

alcohol,lager,My Taste Has Changed—From IPAs & Barrel Proof to Lagers & Speyside Scotch,"I’ve noticed a big shift in my drinking preferences over the years, and I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar.

I used to be all about the bold flavors—hoppy, resinous IPAs and high-proof, barrel-strength bourbons were my go-to. I loved the intensity, the complexity, and the punch they packed. But lately, I find myself reaching for something more refined and easygoing.

These days, I’m really enjoying crisp lagers and pilsners—clean, refreshing, and perfect for kicking back without overwhelming my palate. And when it comes to whisk(e)y, I’ve been gravitating toward Speyside and Islay Scotches. There’s something about their smooth, honeyed, smokey, and slightly fruity profiles that just hits right.

Has anyone else gone through a similar transition? Maybe it's palate fatigue, or just evolving tastes...

19 Crimes is good, it may be a tie with Joel Gott Cabernet Sauvignon in terms of what I prefer. 19 Crimes is very smooth, some ripe berry notes, hints of sweetness somewhat accurate of what is written on the bottle but subtle, and a less toasty butter texture that's a little less prominent. $12 for the bottle, Joel Gott is $11 - $12 but I have not seen it at the convenience store yet.  

  
Thank you so much to those guys recommending me Miller High Life! I like it more than Pabst Blue Ribbon. It is more similar than I anticipated. It has around the same level of creaminess in the texture but with more sweetness and longer lasting carbonation. It's good. I will be able to enjoy this on every occasion. If this is not available for purchase I will take PBR or some random IPA that catches my attention. PBR is cheaper ($7 vs $11 for a 6 pack 16Oz). Of course prices in your area may vary.

  
Some interesting IPA's have shipped to my local convenience store, so that is probably next in the coming weeks! I've been really liking IPA's.",2,0.9869,Positive,0.18330128205128207,Positive,0.5862708423076923,Positive

alcohol,lager,difference effects... lager vs guiness,"hi all,

just wanted some thoughts and opinions.

when i drink guiness, i end up being really placid, maleable, chilled, can be more anxious also.

  
as soon as i switch to a lager (budweiser for example), i immediately become energised, ramped up, can be boisterious, and can also feel i am invicible.

anyone know why i may have such contrasing effects?

the lager i feel is too much, i like the positive aspects (which can actually be viewed as negative... e.g. over confidence, no anxiety, overly energised), but the negative stuff is not good. lager i am more likely to feel regret about my actions the next day. maybe not if i had stayed on guiness all night.

alcohol,lager,Can't stand the taste of lager but...,"Hi all!

So for as long as I remember by Mom has always tried to get me to drink lager, but I just prefer the taste of cider. Beer, ale, lager, whatever, it all just tastes bitter and thick and nasty to me for some reason. I mean, I can drink it in small quantities over a long period of time, but I can't drink it as naturally as I can cider. Is there any way aside from just ""powering through"" to getting used to drinking lager? I've probably tried at least 30-40 different lagers by now, and while I can appreciate the different flavours and subtleties, they all basically give me the same feeling of 'I don't want to continue drinking this...'? 

With that in mind, while I've no problem with just drinking cider I'd like to open my palette so to speak to a wider variety of drinks? Do you have any advice?

So about 4 years ago I had a drink that I thought was really good, I was only 17 at the time and was very hesitant to drink, but now that I am turning 21, I would like to find it. 

It was a fruit flavored drink, came in a brown bottle, and had a picture of the fruit on the cap that was its flavor. For example, the one I had was a pear, it came in a six pack, two of each flavor.

I picked a mix of beers, hard seltzers, and liquor, but I don’t know which ones are worth keeping. If you were in my shoes, which would you keep, remove, or swap out?

Beers:

Guinness Draught Stout (6-pack bottles, 4.2% ABV) – $10.46

White Claw Hard Seltzer Peach (6-pack cans, 5% ABV) – $10.94

Blue Moon Belgian White (6-pack bottles, 5.4% ABV) – $11.73

Stella Artois Lager (12-pack cans, 5% ABV) – $15.27

Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Wheat Ale (6-pack cans, 7.5% ABV) – $10.98


Liquor & Seltzers:

High Noon Lime Vodka Hard Seltzer (4-pack, 12% ABV) – $9.98

Malibu White Rum with Coconut Liqueur (750ml, 21% ABV) – $15.47

Smirnoff No. 21 Vodka (750ml, 40% ABV) – $11.88


Since this is my first time really trying drinks, I want a mix of good flavors, smooth drinks, and stuff that won’t completely wreck me. I like a mix of strong and light drinks, but I don’t want to overspend.

If you had to cut 2-3 from the list, which would you remove? And are there any must-haves I should add?
